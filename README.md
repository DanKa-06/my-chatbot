# Chatbot with Streamlit, Ollama, and ChromaDB

This project is a chatbot that uses Streamlit for the web interface, Ollama for text generation with locally run language models, and ChromaDB for storing and searching vector representations (embeddings) of text, enabling conversational context memory.

## Description

The chatbot allows users to ask questions and receive answers generated by a chosen language model running through Ollama. Using ChromaDB allows us to store conversation history and take into account the context of previous messages for more relevant responses.
